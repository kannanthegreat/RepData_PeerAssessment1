# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Introduction

### The goal of this assignment to practice skills needed for reproducible research. Specifically this assignment use R markdown to write a report that answers the questions detailed in the sections below. In the process, the single R markdown document will be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file.

#### Start this assignment with fork/clone the GitHub repository created for this assignment. When finish, submit this assignment by pushing your completed files into your forked repository on GitHub. The assignment submission will consist of the URL to your GitHub repository and the SHA-1 commit ID for your repository state.

### Data
This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day. The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site: Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K] The variables included in this dataset are:

.steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
.date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.
Loading and preprocessing

Load input data 
```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/kannanthegreat/Documents/Activity monitoring data project/repdata_data_activity/activity.csv")
```
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth = 1000, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")
```
## What is mean and median total number of steps taken per day?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(total.steps, na.rm = TRUE)

median(total.steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x = list(steps = data$steps), by = list(interval = data$interval), 
    FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(data = averages, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + geom_line() + xlab("5-minute interval") + 
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```
## On average across all the days in the dataset, the 5-minute interval contains
the maximum number of steps?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
averages[which.max(averages$steps), ]
```
## Imputing missing values

There are many days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as `NA`). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.
# How many missing?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
missing <- is.na(data$steps)

table(missing)
```
## All of the missing values are filled in with mean value for that 5-minute interval.

## Replace each missing value with the mean value of its 5-minute interval

```{r, echo=TRUE}
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps)) 
        filled <- c(steps) else filled <- (averages[averages$interval == interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```
## make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate the mean and median total number of steps.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN = sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth = 1000, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")
```

 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(total.steps)

median(total.steps)
```
#### Mean and median values are higher after imputing missing data. The reason is that in the original data, there are some days with `steps` values `NA` for any interval. 

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
weekday.or.weekend <- function(date) {
    day <- weekdays(date)
    if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")) 
        return("weekday") else if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) 
        return("weekend") else stop("invalid date")
}
filled.data$date <- as.Date(filled.data$date)
filled.data$day <- sapply(filled.data$date, FUN = weekday.or.weekend)
```


#### Now, let's make a panel plot containing plots of average number of steps taken on weekdays and weekends.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day, data = filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(day ~ .) + 
    xlab("5-minute interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```
### Observations:

#### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends? Yes. The plot indicates that the person moves around more (or more active) during the weekend days.

### Conclusion

#### In this assignment, it provided a step-by-step approach for analyzing data. The data analysis started from loading data, transform data including the strategy and implementation of dealing with missing data, and reporting statistical data and plots.
